I want to present my program for automatic diagnosis of diseases. With the help of this program, it will be possible to reduce mortality in people from various diseases and improve the effectiveness of treatment.

Our program goals: 
1. Increase the accuracy of diagnoses. Artificial intelligence will be able to process more data and detect even invisible diseases and abnormalities, which will eliminate the risk of their development in the future.
2. Speed. AI will be able to analyze data much faster than a human, which is especially necessary in emergency cases to avoid wasting unnecessary time.
3. Elimination of medical errors. With the help of our automated program we can avoid misdiagnosis

How will it be applied?
AI will use various medical indications (X-rays, blood pressure, increased blood sugar, cholesterol), analyze them and predict the occurrence of diseases in the early stages.

In conclusion, it should be said that this development has enormous potential; however, the successful use of this program entirely depends on the quality of the data presented.
