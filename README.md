# Diagnosis of diseases using AI
I want to present my program for automatic diagnosis of diseases. With the help of this program, it will be possible to reduce mortality in people from various diseases and improve the effectiveness of treatment.

## Our program goals: 
1. Increase the accuracy of diagnoses. Artificial intelligence will be able to process more data and detect even invisible diseases and abnormalities, which will eliminate the risk of their development in the future.
2. Speed. AI will be able to analyze data much faster than a human, which is especially necessary in emergency cases to avoid wasting unnecessary time.
3. Elimination of medical errors. With the help of our automated program we can avoid misdiagnosis

## How will it be applied?
AI will use various medical indications (X-rays, blood pressure, increased blood sugar, cholesterol), analyze them and predict the occurrence of diseases in the early stages.

In conclusion, it should be said that this development has enormous potential; however, the successful use of this program entirely depends on the quality of the data presented.




# Automatic video editing using AI.

I would like to introduce you to our service for processing video materials using artificial intelligence, which will help many people improve the quality of their videos.

## The main goals of our project:
1. Simplify the installation process.
This will allow users of our program to create high-quality video materials without specialized skills
2. Save time.
With the help of automated systems, there will be no need to edit videos manually, which will reduce work time
## Functional:
1. Automatically cut out unnecessary frames
2. Gluing scenes
3. Adding transitions
4. Automatic sound processing (noise reduction, volume adjustment)
5. Color correction
6. Recommendations for editing (analyzing audience views and providing the most optimal editing)

This program can greatly improve the quality of all video hosting. This program will provide the most up-to-date processing for your video and will be updated regularly to prevent the recommended processing of our program from becoming outdated.
